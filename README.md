# Objective
Login Automation - Google Cloud Function for Zerodha request token generation, which is separately handled by lambda.

# What does it do?
This is a scheduled job in the morning (can be implemented in free tier google cloud to run every morning after 6.30)

This function requests zerodha to get access token - Zerodha will generate a redirect which is handled separately in a AWS lambda in separate repo zerodha-dynamodb-save-accesstoken with request token as query parameter.

# What is needed to run the code?
- The code itself copied to a Google cloud function (index.js, package.json, .puppeteerrc.cjs)
- Environment Variables defined in .env.sample file

* One of the env variables apiauth - is self defined (random string that you choose), This is returned as a 
query parameter in Zerodha's redirect with request token. This can be used when processing redirected url 
(separately done through AWS lambda - check my repo) to ensure the call was generated by 
this code only and not somewhere else.
